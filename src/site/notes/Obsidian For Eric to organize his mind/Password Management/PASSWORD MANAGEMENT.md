**Bitwarden**

[Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/resources/move-to-bitwarden-from-other-password-manager/) is a password manager where all the accounts and associated passwords used by the Social Innovation Hub are stored securely. The password to log in to Bitwarden must never be saved on any device and is recorded by the lab manager for security.

There is a [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bitwarden-free-password-m/nngceckbapebfimnlniiiahkandclblb?hl=en) which can be used to access passwords easily, but must be logged out at each reset.

There are a number of Bitwarden account each serving its purpose as described below:

1. [sihdevices@gmail.com](mailto:sihdevices@gmail.com): This is our main Bitwarden account and has all our login details for everything we do at the hub. It also stores the password details for the subsequent Bitwarden accounts. However, this bitwarden account shares MacOS Login information with [ruce.community.engagement@gmail.com](mailto:ruce.community.engagement@gmail.com) Bitwarden account.
    
2. [ruce.community.engagement@gmail.com](mailto:ruce.community.engagement@gmail.com) Bitwarden account was made to keep all MacOS related login details separate from [sihdevices@gmail.com](mailto:sihdevices@gmail.com). Therefore, [sihdevices@gmail.com](mailto:sihdevices@gmail.com) now shares all MacOS details that belonged to it with [ruce.community.engagement@gmail.com](mailto:ruce.community.engagement@gmail.com) with the aim to eventually disconnect [sihdevices@gmail.com](mailto:sihdevices@gmail.com) by transferring ownership to [ruce.community.engagement@gmail.com](mailto:ruce.community.engagement@gmail.com).
    
3. [socialinnovationhub.ru@gmail.com](mailto:socialinnovationhub.ru@gmail.com) Bitwarden account was made to keep peopleâ€™s password details. This is because sometimes the lab manager will help setup accounts for people, and some people forget the setup account details. In this case, the lab manager would need to remember them.
    

Every new Equipment Manager should change the Bitwarden and Gmail passwords under [sihdevices@gmail.com](mailto:sihdevices@gmail.com) and [ruce.community.engagement@gmail.com](mailto:ruce.community.engagement@gmail.com) as they are the core of everything, and you want to protect the core. Make the password secure and complicated - a combination of letters, numbers, cases and phrases. The password should be unique and not used anywhere else.
