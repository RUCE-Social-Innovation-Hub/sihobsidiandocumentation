## STORAGE
  


### Google Drive
Rhodes University uses Google Workspace therefore enabling premium access to Drive storage. ==This comes with the ability to create a shared drive storage each 500 GB capacity. ==

Consequently, we have the following shared drives:
- Sih Visitors
- Social Innovation Hub 
- RUCE  

#### Google Drive for Desktop

To easily manage and share content across all your devices and the cloud, use Google’s desktop sync client: Drive for desktop. Drive for desktop can be used to find your Drive files and folders on your computer with Windows File Explorer or macOS Finder.

If you edit, delete, or move a file on the Cloud, the same change happens on your computer and devices, and vice versa. That way, your files are always up to date and can be accessed from any device.


#### Install & set up Drive for desktop

1. Download Drive for desktop:
    [DOWNLOAD FOR WINDOWS](https://dl.google.com/drive-file-stream/GoogleDriveSetup.exe)

2. Open "GoogleDriveSetup.exe."

3. Follow the on-screen instructions.


On Drive for desktop, at the bottom right, in the system tray, you can find the Drive for desktop menu ![Drive File Stream](https://storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/jiEgyvvMKdtzVV3MoCUyl0EWTmekFj0smSXr).
