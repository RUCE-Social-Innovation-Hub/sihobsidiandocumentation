# SIH Fixed Lab


There are a number of ways to connect to the internet from SIH Fixed lab at Rhodes University as documented below.

1. _**rucelab**_ is a hidden network with a highly secure password saved by ITS and the lab managers. You can also find its password on Bitwarden. Only registered devices, whose mac addresses have been added to the database of allowed devices by ITS can connect to rucelab.
    
2. _**RUCE; Social Innovation Hub**_ is our own wifi, password Wsih2022 also on Bitwarden. There are a number of ways to make this wifi.
    
    1. Using a Dell Laptop, connect to eduroam or rucelab, then enable hotspot using the ssid mentioned above. This is however a temporary solution as the laptop may be leased, and also allows only a limited number of laptops to connect simultaneously. Details on how to use the desktop computer as a hotspot can be found here:

    2. Using a Desktop computer connected to the internet via ethernet cable and a usb wifi dongle, you can start a wifi hotspot the same way as (1) above. This works as long as the desktop is turned on. Also, from experience, the wifi signal from this strategy is not that strong and does not travel far, therefore, inadequate for large classes occupying the social innovation hub. Details on how to use the desktop computer as a hotspot can be found here: [[Obsidian For Eric to organize his mind/Internet Connection/Configuring and using PC and laptop hotspot\|Configuring and using PC and laptop hotspot]]
        
    3. Using the Huawei LTE router, connect an ethernet cable from the WAN port of the router to the ethernet outlet on the wall, then plug into the power supply. Our Hub’s router’s ssid and password have already been configured to match the details above, and the router configured to act as a bridge. After you connect to this router’s wifi, you will be brought a login screen, where you will register the router the way you’d register a device connected to the ethernet like a desktop. Once registered, the router’s mac address is attached to your rhodes credentials and anyone who connects to this wifi can now browse the internet. Details for configuring this specific model of the router can be found here:

Whether you're a beginner or looking to refine your network settings, this tutorial will walk you through the necessary steps to get your router up and running efficiently.

## Initial Setup and Connection
To start with the configuration of your Huawei LTE router, follow these steps:
1. **Powering On and Connecting the Router**:
   - Ensure your router is turned on.
   - Use an Ethernet cable to connect your router to your laptop. 
   - Look for the connection icon on your laptop to confirm that the connection is established.

2. **Accessing the Router’s Web Interface**:
   - Open your preferred internet browser.
   - In the address bar, type `192.168.1.1` and press Enter. This will take you to the router’s login page.
   - Log in using the default credentials. Typically, the username and password are both set to "admin".
	   - Please remember to change the login from the default admin to something secure.
