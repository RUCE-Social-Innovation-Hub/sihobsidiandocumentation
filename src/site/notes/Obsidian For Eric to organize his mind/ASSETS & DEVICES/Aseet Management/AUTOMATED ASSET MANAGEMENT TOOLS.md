# AUTOMATED ASSET MANAGEMENT TOOLS

## Gmail Filters

Gmail filters are used to organise incoming emails, especially from services such as [[Obsidian For Eric to organize his mind/ASSETS & DEVICES/Aseet Management/AUTOMATED ASSET REGISTER#[**Asset Tiger**](https //www.myassettag.com/assettiger/dashboard)\|AUTOMATED ASSET REGISTER#[**Asset Tiger**](https //www.myassettag.com/assettiger/dashboard)]] and Equipment request forms described in [[Obsidian For Eric to organize his mind/Communication and Access/COMMUNICATION AND ACCESS#1. [sihvisitors](https //linktr.ee/sihvisitors)\|COMMUNICATION AND ACCESS#1. [sihvisitors](https //linktr.ee/sihvisitors)]]

Zapier is an online automation tool that connects different services online and automating them as needed.   The Free plan offers only two actions such as connecting gmail to google drive or gmail to google tasks.

For our purposes, Zapier is used to generate tasks on [socialinnovationhub.ru@gmail.com](mailto:socialinnovationhub.ru@gmail.com) that relate to assets needing to be renewed as their expiry date comes close. It is also used to transfer attached pdf(s) of various activities to google drive for future reference purposes. These activities are described below in detail.

1. _Asset Tiger -_ Asset Tiger sends an automated email to [socialinnovaitonhub.ru@gmail.com](mailto:socialinnovaitonhub.ru@gmail.com), [t.matyobeni@ru.ac.za](mailto:t.matyobeni@ru.ac.za) and [kamau757@gmail.com](mailto:kamau757@gmail.com) every week on Friday morning with an attached pdf of the current asset status. Basically, the lab manager. This can be customized in Asset Tiger settings. Zapier is used to transfer this attached pdf from [socialinnovationhub.ru@gmail.com](mailto:socialinnovationhub.ru@gmail.com) to the [Asset Tiger Automated reports](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MdppvlIfEs5UvxRdhBIbeDm4ZNQnIJRy?usp=share_link) folder. This is a security measure in case records have been altered.
    
2. _Asset Tiger -_ Asset Tiger also sends a reminder email when equipment is about to expire. Zapier is used to add these emails onto google tasks on [socialinnovationhub.ru@gmail.com](mailto:socialinnovationhub.ru@gmail.com) account. This is just for convenience of the lab manager but can be turned off by clicking on the green raio button under Equipment Return zap on Zapier.
    
3. _Google Forms_ – When someone is in need of equipment, the fill in the google form on the following link: [https://forms.gle/jpZywszPTMD2XfEE8](https://forms.gle/jpZywszPTMD2XfEE8). This form sends an email with the attached pdf summarising what equipment is needed to [socialinnovationhub.ru@gmail.com](mailto:socialinnovationhub.ru@gmail.com), and to the lab manager’s email address. Zapier saves this attached pdf emailed by Google Forms, particularly, the [Proposal for long term loans form](https://forms.gle/jpZywszPTMD2XfEE8), in the [Proposal for equipment use](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11QFnhquAyg9O00DfyeMCIaeYxd_jZR9d?usp=share_link) folder on the shared SIH Drive for our records.

# How to connect gmail to google drive using zapier
when a user requests devices by filling in the [equipment request form](https://linktr.ee/sihvisitors), an email with the equipment request details as well as a pdf attachment with the same is sent out to the socialinnovationhub.ru@gmail.com. 

We use zapier to automatically save these attachments from gmail to google drive in the two-step process shown in the image below. 
![Gmail to Google Drive.png](/img/user/Obsidian%20For%20Eric%20to%20organize%20his%20mind/ASSETS%20&%20DEVICES/Aseet%20Management/Gmail%20to%20Google%20Drive.png)



To setup the zap, we follow the following procedure: 

1. We choose a trigger, which in our case, is the new email: ![Zap App & events 1.png](/img/user/Obsidian%20For%20Eric%20to%20organize%20his%20mind/ASSETS%20&%20DEVICES/Aseet%20Management/Zap%20App%20&%20events%201.png)




2. We then select the email address to use, which, in our case, is the socialinnovationhub.ru@gmail.com:     ![Zap Select email 1.png](/img/user/Obsidian%20For%20Eric%20to%20organize%20his%20mind/ASSETS%20&%20DEVICES/Aseet%20Management/Zap%20Select%20email%201.png)


3. Then we select the trigger, which in this case, is an email that gets filtered into EQUIPMENT/Equipment Loans Proposal tag. To create this filter, we followed the procedure documented in [[Obsidian For Eric to organize his mind/ASSETS & DEVICES/Aseet Management/Setting up Gmail Filters\|Setting up Gmail Filters]] ![Zap Select trigger.png](/img/user/Obsidian%20For%20Eric%20to%20organize%20his%20mind/ASSETS%20&%20DEVICES/Aseet%20Management/Zap%20Select%20trigger.png)


4. Then we test and see if zapier is able to recover an email with the given parameters  ![Zap Test 1.png](/img/user/Obsidian%20For%20Eric%20to%20organize%20his%20mind/ASSETS%20&%20DEVICES/Aseet%20Management/Zap%20Test%201.png)


5. Once the test is successful, we proceed to select the next app and action that the app will take should there be an incoming email, which in our case, is to upload the pdf attached to an email ![Zap App & Event Drive 1.png](/img/user/Obsidian%20For%20Eric%20to%20organize%20his%20mind/ASSETS%20&%20DEVICES/Aseet%20Management/Zap%20App%20&%20Event%20Drive%201.png)


6. The next step is specifying which google drive account should the file be uploaded to ![Zap Google Drive account 1.png](/img/user/Obsidian%20For%20Eric%20to%20organize%20his%20mind/ASSETS%20&%20DEVICES/Aseet%20Management/Zap%20Google%20Drive%20account%201.png)


7. Then we specify all the details regarding which google drive to use, which folder to use in the drive, and specifying that all attachments be uploaded as shown in the image:     ![Zap Google Drive Details 1.png](/img/user/Obsidian%20For%20Eric%20to%20organize%20his%20mind/ASSETS%20&%20DEVICES/Aseet%20Management/Zap%20Google%20Drive%20Details%201.png)


8. Then we finally test then publish the zap ![Zap Test & Publish 1.png](/img/user/Obsidian%20For%20Eric%20to%20organize%20his%20mind/ASSETS%20&%20DEVICES/Aseet%20Management/Zap%20Test%20&%20Publish%201.png)
