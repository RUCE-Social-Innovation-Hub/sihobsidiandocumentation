# ASSET MANAGEMENT
## ASSET TAGS
In order to keep track of various assets available, there is need to develop a tagging system that would differentiate the different asssets that are of the same type. This makes it also easier to give information about a specific asset without confusion as to which asset is being referred to.


#### Barcodes
Barcodes for smaller non-RU assets are catalogued in the Google Drive on the [SIH asset tags (barcodes)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15AfW-mC6pktVMW2x2FFRot9Gs58E7M1z/edit#gid=173501204) Google Sheets. Copies are in the cupboard for loans and a copy is in the Office. It is updated as new accessories are added.

On the ‘unused’ tab of the [SIH asset tags (barcodes)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15AfW-mC6pktVMW2x2FFRot9Gs58E7M1z/edit#gid=173501204) Google sheets are all the new asset tags that have not been used. A Google Sheet function is used to automatically generate barcodes from a website called Berrywing.com. The equation is inserted on every row of the ‘Barcode’ column, where C3 is row 3 of ASSET Tag Column with all the asset tags that you want to generate the barcode from. The barcodes are generated using the equation:

=if(isblank(C3), "BLANK",image("http://berrywing.com/barcode/Code128.aspx?bc=" & C3))

## ASSET REGISTER
Asset registers are methods through which we keep track of our assets. There are divided into two groups, the manual and automated methods.

## [**Zapier.com**](https://zapier.com/)

Zapier is an online automation tool that connects different services online and automating them as needed.   The Free plan offers only two actions such as connecting gmail to google drive or gmail to google tasks.

For our purposes, Zapier is used to generate tasks on [socialinnovationhub.ru@gmail.com](mailto:socialinnovationhub.ru@gmail.com) that relate to assets needing to be renewed as their expiry date comes close. It is also used to transfer attached pdf(s) of various activities to google drive for future reference purposes. These activities are described below in detail.

  
  
![Zapier.png](/img/user/Obsidian%20For%20Eric%20to%20organize%20his%20mind/ASSETS%20&%20DEVICES/Aseet%20Management/Zapier.png)

  
  

1. _Asset Tiger -_ Asset Tiger sends an automated email to [socialinnovaitonhub.ru@gmail.com](mailto:socialinnovaitonhub.ru@gmail.com), [t.matyobeni@ru.ac.za](mailto:t.matyobeni@ru.ac.za) and [kamau757@gmail.com](mailto:kamau757@gmail.com) every week on Friday morning with an attached pdf of the current asset status. Basically, the lab manager. This can be customized in Asset Tiger settings. Zapier is used to transfer this attached pdf from [socialinnovationhub.ru@gmail.com](mailto:socialinnovationhub.ru@gmail.com) to the [Asset Tiger Automated reports](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MdppvlIfEs5UvxRdhBIbeDm4ZNQnIJRy?usp=share_link) folder. This is a security measure in case records have been altered.
    
2. _Asset Tiger -_ Asset Tiger also sends a reminder email when equipment is about to expire. Zapier is used to add these emails onto google tasks on [socialinnovationhub.ru@gmail.com](mailto:socialinnovationhub.ru@gmail.com) account. This is just for convenience of the lab manager but can be turned off by clicking on the green raio button under Equipment Return zap on Zapier.
    
3. _Google Forms_ – When someone is in need of equipment, the fill in the google form on the following link: [https://forms.gle/jpZywszPTMD2XfEE8](https://forms.gle/jpZywszPTMD2XfEE8). This form sends an email with the attached pdf summarising what equipment is needed to [socialinnovationhub.ru@gmail.com](mailto:socialinnovationhub.ru@gmail.com), and to the lab manager’s email address. Zapier saves this attached pdf emailed by Google Forms, particularly, the [Proposal for long term loans form](https://forms.gle/jpZywszPTMD2XfEE8), in the [Proposal for equipment use](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11QFnhquAyg9O00DfyeMCIaeYxd_jZR9d?usp=share_link) folder on the shared SIH Drive for our records.

# How to connect gmail to google drive using zapier
when a user requests devices by filling in the [equipment request form](https://linktr.ee/sihvisitors), an email with the equipment request details as well as a pdf attachment with the same is sent out to the socialinnovationhub.ru@gmail.com. 

We use zapier to automatically save these attachments from gmail to google drive in the two-step process shown in the image below. 
![Gmail to Google Drive.png](/img/user/Obsidian%20For%20Eric%20to%20organize%20his%20mind/ASSETS%20&%20DEVICES/Aseet%20Management/Gmail%20to%20Google%20Drive.png)



To setup the zap, we follow the following procedure: 

1. We choose a trigger, which in our case, is the new email: ![Zap App & events 1.png](/img/user/Obsidian%20For%20Eric%20to%20organize%20his%20mind/ASSETS%20&%20DEVICES/Aseet%20Management/Zap%20App%20&%20events%201.png)




2. We then select the email address to use, which, in our case, is the socialinnovationhub.ru@gmail.com:     ![Zap Select email 1.png](/img/user/Obsidian%20For%20Eric%20to%20organize%20his%20mind/ASSETS%20&%20DEVICES/Aseet%20Management/Zap%20Select%20email%201.png)


3. Then we select the trigger, which in this case, is an email that gets filtered into EQUIPMENT/Equipment Loans Proposal tag. To create this filter, we followed the procedure documented in [[Obsidian For Eric to organize his mind/ASSETS & DEVICES/Aseet Management/Setting up Gmail Filters\|Setting up Gmail Filters]] ![Zap Select trigger.png](/img/user/Obsidian%20For%20Eric%20to%20organize%20his%20mind/ASSETS%20&%20DEVICES/Aseet%20Management/Zap%20Select%20trigger.png)


4. Then we test and see if zapier is able to recover an email with the given parameters  ![Zap Test 1.png](/img/user/Obsidian%20For%20Eric%20to%20organize%20his%20mind/ASSETS%20&%20DEVICES/Aseet%20Management/Zap%20Test%201.png)


5. Once the test is successful, we proceed to select the next app and action that the app will take should there be an incoming email, which in our case, is to upload the pdf attached to an email ![Zap App & Event Drive 1.png](/img/user/Obsidian%20For%20Eric%20to%20organize%20his%20mind/ASSETS%20&%20DEVICES/Aseet%20Management/Zap%20App%20&%20Event%20Drive%201.png)


6. The next step is specifying which google drive account should the file be uploaded to ![Zap Google Drive account 1.png](/img/user/Obsidian%20For%20Eric%20to%20organize%20his%20mind/ASSETS%20&%20DEVICES/Aseet%20Management/Zap%20Google%20Drive%20account%201.png)


7. Then we specify all the details regarding which google drive to use, which folder to use in the drive, and specifying that all attachments be uploaded as shown in the image:     ![Zap Google Drive Details 1.png](/img/user/Obsidian%20For%20Eric%20to%20organize%20his%20mind/ASSETS%20&%20DEVICES/Aseet%20Management/Zap%20Google%20Drive%20Details%201.png)


8. Then we finally test then publish the zap ![Zap Test & Publish 1.png](/img/user/Obsidian%20For%20Eric%20to%20organize%20his%20mind/ASSETS%20&%20DEVICES/Aseet%20Management/Zap%20Test%20&%20Publish%201.png)

## ASSET TRACKING
The following devices are being tracked.

- MacOS Tracking happens using the [Find My](https://www.apple.com/icloud/find-my/) app on MacOS. All MacOS have a DST MAC # admin account. This Admin account must not be shared. This admin account is logged into the apple ID using [sihdevices@gmail.com](mailto:sihdevices@gmail.com), password in Bitwarden. It is this apple ID You can also access the web portal to track MacOS using this link: [https://www.icloud.com/find](https://www.icloud.com/find). It is very accurate in tracking.
    
- Android devices can be tracked using the following link: [https://www.google.com/android/find](https://www.google.com/android/find). They all use [sihvisitors@gmail.com](mailto:sihvisitors@gmail.com) as their default account. You will need to be are logged in using [sihvisitors@gmail.com](mailto:sihvisitors@gmail.com) in order to track them. Password in Bitwarden. As this is a public gmail account, they will be moved to a separate gmail account, different from [sihdevices@gmail.com](mailto:sihdevices@gmail.com). It is used to track the 10” tablets but not very accurate.
    
    - Samsung Tablets can be tracked using the link: [https://findmymobile.samsung.com](https://findmymobile.samsung.com/). They are using [sihdevices@gmail.com](mailto:sihdevices@gmail.com) samsung account; login in Bitwarden.
        
- Windows Laptops can be tracked using the following link: [https://account.microsoft.com/devices](https://account.microsoft.com/devices). They are logged in using [sihdevices@gmail.com](mailto:sihdevices@gmail.com) Microsoft account on the RUCE Admin account. Login details can be found in the main Bitwarden account. This Admin account must not be shared. It is not very accurate in tracking.






## SECURITY FLAWS IN ASSET TRACKING


### macOS

#### Security of Tracking Mechanisms:
1. [**Find My Mac**](https://www.icloud.com/find): Apple provides a built-in tracking mechanism called "Find My Mac" which integrates with iCloud.  uses the apple ID 
   - **Activation Lock**: This feature ties the device to Social Innovation hub Apple ID, requiring the ID and password, found on Bitwarden, to disable Find My Mac or reactivate the device after it has been erased.
#### How Easy to Circumvent:
1. **Bypassing Activation Lock**:
   - **Firmware Reset**: A determined thief might attempt to perform a firmware reset using tools like Apple Configurator, but this often requires access to another Mac.
   - **Professional Tools**: There are illegal tools and services that claim to bypass Apple's Activation Lock, but these often require physical access to the hardware and are not easily accessible to average users.
2. **Removing the Hard Drive**:
   - **Replacement**: Removing and replacing the hard drive can circumvent the software-based tracking, but this also involves significant technical skills and tools, and the data on the original drive would be lost.



### WindowsOS

#### Security of Tracking Mechanisms:
1. [**Find My Device**](https://account.microsoft.com/devices?lang=en-GB#main-content-landing-react): Windows offers "Find My Device" which links to a Microsoft account who's password can also be found in Bitwarden.
   - **BitLocker Encryption**: If enabled, BitLocker provides disk encryption, adding a layer of security. However, to re-install the operating system, one needs to disable bitlocker encryption. 
   - **Secure Boot**: Ensures that the device boots using only trusted software from the OEM. May need to be disabled when installing windows operating system as described in [[Obsidian For Eric to organize his mind/ASSETS & DEVICES/Device Maintenance/Installing Windows 10 on a PC or laptop\|Installing Windows 10 on a PC or laptop]]
#### How Easy to Circumvent:
1. **Disabling Find My Device**:
   - **Local Account**: If the thief can access the local account settings, they might disable the Find My Device feature, although this typically requires administrator privileges.
   - **Factory Reset**: A factory reset can disable tracking, though BitLocker may prevent data access if enabled.
2. **Boot from External Media**:
   - **Live USB/CD**: Booting from an external USB drive or CD with a Linux distribution can bypass the Windows OS, although this does not necessarily disable tracking but can provide access to the device without triggering it.
   - **Reset BIOS/UEFI**: Resetting BIOS/UEFI settings to disable Secure Boot can help in accessing the device, but requires technical knowledge and can be easily blocked by enabling BitLocker Encryption.



### AndroidOS

#### Security of Tracking Mechanisms:
1. [**Find My Device**](https://www.google.com/android/find/): Android’s built-in tracking mechanism for the social innovation hub android devices links to the Google account sihvisitors@gmail.com .
   - **Factory Reset Protection (FRP)**: This feature prevents the device from being used after a factory reset without the original Google account credentials. However, it varies with device make and model. 
   - **Google Play Protect**: Continuously scans for malware and provides some level of security against unauthorized access.

#### How Easy to Circumvent:
1. **Disabling Find My Device**:
   - **Factory Reset**: Performing a factory reset is a common way to disable tracking, but FRP ensures that the device cannot be reactivated without the original credentials.
2. **Bypassing FRP**:
   - **Exploits and Tools**: There are known exploits and third-party tools that can bypass FRP, but these are often patched by Google and require technical knowledge.
   - **Custom ROMs**: Installing a custom ROM can circumvent factory settings and disable tracking features, but this requires unlocking the bootloader, which is not always possible without the original owner's consent.
3. **Physical Access**:
   - **Hardware Tampering**: Removing the battery (if possible) or altering hardware components can disable tracking, but modern devices with non-removable batteries make this difficult.




### Other Devices
Other devices such as cameras and tripod stands are not tracked.
