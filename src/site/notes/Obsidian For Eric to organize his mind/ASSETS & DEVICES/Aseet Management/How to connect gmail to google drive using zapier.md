# How to connect gmail to google drive using zapier
when a user requests devices by filling in the [equipment request form](https://linktr.ee/sihvisitors), an email with the equipment request details as well as a pdf attachment with the same is sent out to the socialinnovationhub.ru@gmail.com. 

We use zapier to automatically save these attachments from gmail to google drive in the two-step process shown in the image below.

To setup the zap, we follow the following procedure: 

1. We choose a trigger, which in our case, is the new email: ![Zap App & events 1.png](/img/user/Obsidian%20For%20Eric%20to%20organize%20his%20mind/ASSETS%20&%20DEVICES/Aseet%20Management/Zap%20App%20&%20events%201.png)




2. We then select the email address to use, which, in our case, is the socialinnovationhub.ru@gmail.com:     ![Zap Select email 1.png](/img/user/Obsidian%20For%20Eric%20to%20organize%20his%20mind/ASSETS%20&%20DEVICES/Aseet%20Management/Zap%20Select%20email%201.png)


3. Then we select the trigger, which in this case, is an email that gets filtered into EQUIPMENT/Equipment Loans Proposal tag. To create this filter, we followed the procedure documented in [[Obsidian For Eric to organize his mind/ASSETS & DEVICES/Aseet Management/Setting up Gmail Filters\|Setting up Gmail Filters]] ![Zap Select trigger.png](/img/user/Obsidian%20For%20Eric%20to%20organize%20his%20mind/ASSETS%20&%20DEVICES/Aseet%20Management/Zap%20Select%20trigger.png)


4. Then we test and see if zapier is able to recover an email with the given parameters  ![Zap Test 1.png](/img/user/Obsidian%20For%20Eric%20to%20organize%20his%20mind/ASSETS%20&%20DEVICES/Aseet%20Management/Zap%20Test%201.png)


5. Once the test is successful, we proceed to select the next app and action that the app will take should there be an incoming email, which in our case, is to upload the pdf attached to an email ![Zap App & Event Drive 1.png](/img/user/Obsidian%20For%20Eric%20to%20organize%20his%20mind/ASSETS%20&%20DEVICES/Aseet%20Management/Zap%20App%20&%20Event%20Drive%201.png)


6. The next step is specifying which google drive account should the file be uploaded to ![Zap Google Drive account 1.png](/img/user/Obsidian%20For%20Eric%20to%20organize%20his%20mind/ASSETS%20&%20DEVICES/Aseet%20Management/Zap%20Google%20Drive%20account%201.png)


7. Then we specify all the details regarding which google drive to use, which folder to use in the drive, and specifying that all attachments be uploaded as shown in the image:     ![Zap Google Drive Details 1.png](/img/user/Obsidian%20For%20Eric%20to%20organize%20his%20mind/ASSETS%20&%20DEVICES/Aseet%20Management/Zap%20Google%20Drive%20Details%201.png)


8. Then we finally test then publish the zap ![Zap Test & Publish 1.png](/img/user/Obsidian%20For%20Eric%20to%20organize%20his%20mind/ASSETS%20&%20DEVICES/Aseet%20Management/Zap%20Test%20&%20Publish%201.png)
