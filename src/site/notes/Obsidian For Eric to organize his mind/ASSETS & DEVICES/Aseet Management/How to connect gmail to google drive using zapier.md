# How to connect gmail to google drive using zapier
when a user requests devices by filling in the [equipment request form](https://linktr.ee/sihvisitors), an email with the equipment request details as well as a pdf attachment with the same is sent out to the socialinnovationhub.ru@gmail.com. 

We use zapier to automatically save these attachments from gmail to google drive in the two-step process shown in the image below.

To setup the zap, we follow the following procedure: 

1. We choose a trigger, which in our case, is the new email: ![Zap App & events 1.png](/img/user/Obsidian%20For%20Eric%20to%20organize%20his%20mind/ASSETS%20&%20DEVICES/Aseet%20Management/Zap%20App%20&%20events%201.png)




2. We then select the email address to use, which, in our case, is the socialinnovationhub.ru@gmail.com:     ![Zap Select email 1.png](/img/user/Obsidian%20For%20Eric%20to%20organize%20his%20mind/ASSETS%20&%20DEVICES/Aseet%20Management/Zap%20Select%20email%201.png)


3. Then we select the trigger, which in this case, is an email that gets filtered into EQUIPMENT/Equipment Loans Proposal tag. To create this filter, we followed the procedure documented in [[Obsidian For Eric to organize his mind/ASSETS & DEVICES/Aseet Management/Setting up Gmail Filters\|Setting up Gmail Filters]] ![Zap Select trigger.png](/img/user/Obsidian%20For%20Eric%20to%20organize%20his%20mind/ASSETS%20&%20DEVICES/Aseet%20Management/Zap%20Select%20trigger.png)
