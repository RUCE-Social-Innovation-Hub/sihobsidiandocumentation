# WINDOWS ISO & SOFTWARE


We keep all our ISO(s) and ISO installation software downloaded and stored locally on a flash drive as shown below, ==as well as on Google Drive on this link: ------==. This enables us to work both offline in situations where there is no internet access, as well as work faster in that we wont have to wait for an ISO file to download before setting up a bootable flashdrive.

#### WINDOWS ISO(S)

The flash drive shown above has the following list of windows ISO files in the main OS ISO folder:
1. en-us_windows_10_iot_enterprise_ltsc_2021_x64_dvd_257ad90f.iso which can also be downloaded from https://archive.org/details/en-us_windows_10_enterprise_ltsc_2021_x64_dvd_d289cf96_202212
2. Win_10_Pro_Build_18363.1909.476.iso which can also be downloaded from https://archive.org/details/win10pro1909.476lite


Details of the two ISO(s) are as follows:

1. en-us_windows_10_iot_enterprise_ltsc_2021_x64_dvd_257ad90f.iso is our version 1 windows installation ISO and the one we use on a regular at the Social Innovation Hub. It is a Long Term Servicing Channel, a version of Windows 10 that is designed for use cases where stability and compatibility are more important than access to new features. LTSC releases of Windows 10 are intended for devices that are used in critical systems, such as medical equipment or air traffic control systems or industrial controllers. The primary reason why we use this in the Social Innovation Hub is to reduce the number of windows feature updates, and get a more cleaner version of windows with minimum bloatware.
    
2. Win_10_Pro_Build_18363.1909.476.iso is our windows lean version 2 windows installation. Windows 10 Lean is a smaller edition of Windows 10 for devices with 16GB of storage or less. It is also known as Windows 10 CloudE or Windows 10 S. It has a smaller footprint and less features than the regular Windows 10, such as no Registry Editor, no Microsoft Management Console, no wallpapers, no drivers for CD/DVD drives, and so on. It is designed to run faster and more efficiently on low-end devices. We use this as our version 3 windows installation because it does not have bloatware at all and can run efficiently on low specs devices. However, we will have to hunt down for drivers for this version of windows.
    
The rest of the ISO files in the Archive folder are experimental and have not been fully implemented. 
	Please feel free to play around with them as per requirements. However, Windows 10 Lite Edition 19H2 x64.iso seemed to run slow for some strange reason after installation. It slowed down the computer using this version of windows and i needed more time to investigate. tiny10 21H2 x64 2209.iso is still untested.
