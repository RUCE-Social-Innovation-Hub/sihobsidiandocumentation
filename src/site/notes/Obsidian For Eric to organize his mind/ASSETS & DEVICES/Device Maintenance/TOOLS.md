# TOOLS

This is where we document a list of all online and software tools that are used in device maintenance 

  
  

## [**TeamViewer**](https://www.teamviewer.com/en-us/) **/** [**Anydesk**](https://anydesk.com/en)

TeamViewer / Anydesk can be used to remotely access a desktop using the internet. We have a teamviewer account under [sihdevices@gmail.com](mailto:sihdevices@gmail.com) with password in Bitwarden. Both TeamViewer and Anydesk are used to troubleshoot devices remotely and also in online digital storytelling workshops to troubleshoot editing.
