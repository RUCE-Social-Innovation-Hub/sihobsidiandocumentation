The DRL is a public access library of basic technologies. This includes computing devices like laptops, mobile devices like tablets, audio-visual devices like cameras and recorders and a range of accessories.

To ensure the sustainability of the library, the management of devices and leases must be well structured. As a digital social innovation, the library uses accessible digital tools to manage its operations.

This document describes the management and operations of the digital resource centre.

## ASSET TAGS
In order to keep track of various assets available, there is need to develop a tagging system that would differentiate the different asssets that are of the same type. This makes it also easier to give information about a specific asset without confusion as to which asset is being referred to.


#### Barcodes
Barcodes for smaller non-RU assets are catalogued in the Google Drive on the [SIH asset tags (barcodes)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15AfW-mC6pktVMW2x2FFRot9Gs58E7M1z/edit#gid=173501204) Google Sheets. Copies are in the cupboard for loans and a copy is in the Office. It is updated as new accessories are added.

On the ‘unused’ tab of the [SIH asset tags (barcodes)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15AfW-mC6pktVMW2x2FFRot9Gs58E7M1z/edit#gid=173501204) Google sheets are all the new asset tags that have not been used. A Google Sheet function is used to automatically generate barcodes from a website called Berrywing.com. The equation is inserted on every row of the ‘Barcode’ column, where C3 is row 3 of ASSET Tag Column with all the asset tags that you want to generate the barcode from. The barcodes are generated using the equation:

=if(isblank(C3), "BLANK",image("http://berrywing.com/barcode/Code128.aspx?bc=" & C3))

## ASSET REGISTER
Asset registers are methods through which we keep track of our assets. There are divided into two groups, the manual and automated methods.

## [**Zapier.com**](https://zapier.com/)

Zapier is an online automation tool that connects different services online and automating them as needed.   

For our purposes, Zapier is used to generate tasks on [socialinnovationhub.ru@gmail.com](mailto:socialinnovationhub.ru@gmail.com) that relate to assets needing to be renewed as their expiry date comes close. It is also used to transfer attached pdf(s) of various activities to google drive for future reference purposes. These activities are described below in detail.

  
  
![Zapier.png](/img/user/Obsidian%20For%20Eric%20to%20organize%20his%20mind/ASSETS%20&%20DEVICES/Aseet%20Management/Zapier.png)

  
  

1. _Asset Tiger -_ Asset Tiger sends an automated email to [socialinnovaitonhub.ru@gmail.com](mailto:socialinnovaitonhub.ru@gmail.com), [t.matyobeni@ru.ac.za](mailto:t.matyobeni@ru.ac.za) and [kamau757@gmail.com](mailto:kamau757@gmail.com) every week on Friday morning with an attached pdf of the current asset status. Basically, the lab manager. This can be customized in Asset Tiger settings. Zapier is used to transfer this attached pdf from [socialinnovationhub.ru@gmail.com](mailto:socialinnovationhub.ru@gmail.com) to the [Asset Tiger Automated reports](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MdppvlIfEs5UvxRdhBIbeDm4ZNQnIJRy?usp=share_link) folder. This is a security measure in case records have been altered.
    
2. _Asset Tiger -_ Asset Tiger also sends a reminder email when equipment is about to expire. Zapier is used to add these emails onto google tasks on [socialinnovationhub.ru@gmail.com](mailto:socialinnovationhub.ru@gmail.com) account. This is just for convenience of the lab manager but can be turned off by clicking on the green raio button under Equipment Return zap on Zapier.
    
3. _Google Forms_ – When someone is in need of equipment, the fill in the google form on the following link: [https://forms.gle/jpZywszPTMD2XfEE8](https://forms.gle/jpZywszPTMD2XfEE8). This form sends an email with the attached pdf summarising what equipment is needed to [socialinnovationhub.ru@gmail.com](mailto:socialinnovationhub.ru@gmail.com), and to the lab manager’s email address. Zapier saves this attached pdf emailed by Google Forms, particularly, the [Proposal for long term loans form](https://forms.gle/jpZywszPTMD2XfEE8), in the [Proposal for equipment use](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11QFnhquAyg9O00DfyeMCIaeYxd_jZR9d?usp=share_link) folder on the shared SIH Drive for our records.

## ASSET TRACKING
The following devices are being tracked.

- MacOS Tracking happens using the [Find My](https://www.apple.com/icloud/find-my/) app on MacOS. All MacOS have a DST MAC # admin account. This Admin account must not be shared. This admin account is logged into the apple ID using [sihdevices@gmail.com](mailto:sihdevices@gmail.com), password in Bitwarden. It is this apple ID You can also access the web portal to track MacOS using this link: [https://www.icloud.com/find](https://www.icloud.com/find). It is very accurate in tracking.
    
- Android devices can be tracked using the following link: [https://www.google.com/android/find](https://www.google.com/android/find). They all use [sihvisitors@gmail.com](mailto:sihvisitors@gmail.com) as their default account. You will need to be are logged in using [sihvisitors@gmail.com](mailto:sihvisitors@gmail.com) in order to track them. Password in Bitwarden. As this is a public gmail account, they will be moved to a separate gmail account, different from [sihdevices@gmail.com](mailto:sihdevices@gmail.com). It is used to track the 10” tablets but not very accurate.
    
    - Samsung Tablets can be tracked using the link: [https://findmymobile.samsung.com](https://findmymobile.samsung.com/). They are using [sihdevices@gmail.com](mailto:sihdevices@gmail.com) samsung account; login in Bitwarden.
        
- Windows Laptops can be tracked using the following link: [https://account.microsoft.com/devices](https://account.microsoft.com/devices). They are logged in using [sihdevices@gmail.com](mailto:sihdevices@gmail.com) Microsoft account on the RUCE Admin account. Login details can be found in the main Bitwarden account. This Admin account must not be shared. It is not very accurate in tracking.

We keep all our iso(s) downloaded and stored locally on a flashdrive as shown below. This enables us to work both offline, within the community, in situations where there is no internet access, as well as work faster in that we wont have to wait for an iso file to download before setting up a bootable flashdrive. 

<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zhzBUqErzzv-wlB8AUT5NgbKDJbUQzMq/view" width="800" height="600" title="Embedded Google Doc"></iframe>


The flashdrive shown above has the following list of windows iso files:
1. 


This file is meant to document the differences between the different iso files in this flashdrive.

1. en-us_windows_10_iot_enterprise_ltsc_2021_x64_dvd_257ad90f.iso is our version 2 windows installation iso. It is a Long Term Servicing Channel, a version of Windows 10 that is designed for use cases where stability and compatibility are more important than access to new features. LTSC releases of Windows 10 are intended for devices that are used in critical systems, such as medical equipment or air traffic control systems or industrial controllers. The primary reason why we use this in the hub is to reduce the number of windows feature updates, and get a more cleaner version of windows with minimum bloatware.
    
2. Win_10_Pro_Build_18363.1909.476.iso is our windows lean version 3 windows installation. Windows 10 Lean is a smaller edition of Windows 10 for devices with 16GB of storage or less1. It is also known as Windows 10 CloudE or Windows 10 S. It has a smaller footprint and less features than the regular Windows 10, such as no Registry Editor, no Microsoft Management Console, no wallpapers, no drivers for CD/DVD drives, and so on. It is designed to run faster and more efficiently on low-end devices. We use this as our version 3 windows installation because it does not have bloatware at all and can run effeciently on low specs devices. However, we will have to hunt down for drivers for this version of windows.
    

### Miscalleneous

[](https://github.com/RUCE-Social-Innovation-Hub/RUCE-SIH-Offline-Software-Installation/tree/OS_ISO#-miscalleneous)

As of the time i wrote this documentation, the remaining versions of windows were lagely untested. Please feel free to play around with them as per requirements. However, Windows 10 Lite Edition 19H2 x64.iso seemed to run slow for some strange reason after installation - It slowed down the computer using this version of windows and i needed more time to investigate. tiny10 21H2 x64 2209.iso is still untested.

Version 1 of windows refers to the version that came pre-installed with the computer.

</div></div>



1. _Windows OS installation_ Which can be found on the [OS_ISO](https://github.com/RUCE-Social-Innovation-Hub/RUCE-SIH-Offline-Software-Installation/tree/OS_ISO) branch of our github documentation

<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Fw-_nMnFrNlqqTzO25SSzY3WYpZ1tUOs/view?usp=drive_link" width="800" height="600" title="Embedded Google Doc"></iframe>


The 4 Bootable flashdrives to the right are Windows 10 installation drives with the following differences:

_**Pink:**_ This flashdrive has Windows 10 Lean installed. Windows 10 lean is suitable for low spec or very old computers as it does not need a lot of resources to run. The price to pay is having to find drivers.

_**Blue & Purple:**_ These flashdrives have Windows 10 LTSC UEFI version. This uses more resources than Windows 10 Lean, but less than the manufacturer installed windows 10. It is suitable for medium-capacity computers. Practically, it can be used interchangeably with Windows 10 Lean, but Windows 10 Lean feels more snappier when using compared to LTSC windows 10.

_**Red:**_ This flashdrive has Windows 10 LTSC Legacy installation. It is used to install windows in old desktop computers that do not support UEFI mode.

  








To the right, the flashdrive has all the iso and software that can be used to create Bootable flashdrives

2. _Software Installation._ Which can be found on the [Win10_lean](https://github.com/RUCE-Social-Innovation-Hub/RUCE-SIH-Offline-Software-Installation/tree/Win10_lean) or [Win10_LTSC](https://github.com/RUCE-Social-Innovation-Hub/RUCE-SIH-Offline-Software-Installation/tree/Win10_LTSC) branches of our github account. These flash drives are to be used with their respective flavors of windows installation. They contain scripts which creates user accounts, removes excess programmes and installs required programmes.

**Bitwarden**

[Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/resources/move-to-bitwarden-from-other-password-manager/) is a password manager where all the accounts and associated passwords used by the Social Innovation Hub are stored securely. The password to log in to Bitwarden must never be saved on any device and is recorded by the lab manager for security.

There is a [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bitwarden-free-password-m/nngceckbapebfimnlniiiahkandclblb?hl=en) which can be used to access passwords easily, but must be logged out at each reset.

There are a number of Bitwarden account each serving its purpose as described below:

1. [sihdevices@gmail.com](mailto:sihdevices@gmail.com): This is our main Bitwarden account and has all our login details for everything we do at the hub. It also stores the password details for the subsequent Bitwarden accounts. However, this bitwarden account shares MacOS Login information with [ruce.community.engagement@gmail.com](mailto:ruce.community.engagement@gmail.com) Bitwarden account.
    
2. [ruce.community.engagement@gmail.com](mailto:ruce.community.engagement@gmail.com) Bitwarden account was made to keep all MacOS related login details separate from [sihdevices@gmail.com](mailto:sihdevices@gmail.com). Therefore, [sihdevices@gmail.com](mailto:sihdevices@gmail.com) now shares all MacOS details that belonged to it with [ruce.community.engagement@gmail.com](mailto:ruce.community.engagement@gmail.com) with the aim to eventually disconnect [sihdevices@gmail.com](mailto:sihdevices@gmail.com) by transferring ownership to [ruce.community.engagement@gmail.com](mailto:ruce.community.engagement@gmail.com).
    
3. [socialinnovationhub.ru@gmail.com](mailto:socialinnovationhub.ru@gmail.com) Bitwarden account was made to keep people’s password details. This is because sometimes the lab manager will help setup accounts for people, and some people forget the setup account details. In this case, the lab manager would need to remember them.
    

Every new Equipment Manager should change the Bitwarden and Gmail passwords under [sihdevices@gmail.com](mailto:sihdevices@gmail.com) and [ruce.community.engagement@gmail.com](mailto:ruce.community.engagement@gmail.com) as they are the core of everything, and you want to protect the core. Make the password secure and complicated - a combination of letters, numbers, cases and phrases. The password should be unique and not used anywhere else.

There are a number of ways to connect to the internet from SIH Fixed lab at Rhodes University as documented below.

1. _**rucelab**_ is a hidden network with a highly secure password saved by ITS and the lab managers. You can also find its password on Bitwarden. Only registered devices, whose mac addresses have been added to the database of allowed devices by ITS can connect to rucelab.
    
2. _**RUCE; Social Innovation Hub**_ is our own wifi, password Wsih2022 also on Bitwarden. There are a number of ways to make this wifi.
    
    1. Using a Dell Laptop, connect to eduroam or rucelab, then enable hotspot using the ssid mentioned above. This is however a temporary solution as the laptop may be leased, and also allows only a limited number of laptops to connect simultaneously. ==Details on how to use the desktop computer as a hotspot can be found here:== 
<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><a class="markdown-embed-link" href="/obsidian-for-eric-to-organize-his-mind/internet-connection/configuring-and-using-pc-and-laptop-hotspot/" aria-label="Open link"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon lucide-link"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a><div class="markdown-embed">






</div></div>

        
    2. Using a Desktop computer connected to the internet via ethernet cable and a usb wifi dongle, you can start a wifi hotspot the same way as (1) above. This works as long as the desktop is turned on. Also, from experience, the wifi signal from this strategy is not that strong and does not travel far, therefore, inadequate for large classes occupying the social innovation hub. ==Details on how to use the desktop computer as a hotspot can be found here:== 
<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><a class="markdown-embed-link" href="/obsidian-for-eric-to-organize-his-mind/internet-connection/configuring-and-using-pc-and-laptop-hotspot/" aria-label="Open link"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon lucide-link"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a><div class="markdown-embed">

    3. Using the Huawei LTE router, connect an ethernet cable from the WAN port of the router to the ethernet outlet on the wall, then plug into the power supply. Our Hub’s router’s ssid and password have already been configured to match the details above, and the router configured to act as a bridge. After you connect to this router’s wifi, you will be brought a login screen, where you will register the router the way you’d register a device connected to the ethernet like a desktop. Once registered, the router’s mac address is attached to your rhodes credentials and anyone who connects to this wifi can now browse the internet. ==Details for configuring this specific model of the router can be found here:== 
<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><a class="markdown-embed-link" href="/obsidian-for-eric-to-organize-his-mind/internet-connection/configuring-huawei-lte-router-to-act-as-a-bridge/" aria-label="Open link"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon lucide-link"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a><div class="markdown-embed">






</div></div>

        
        1. Please note we have a go ahead from IT to do this and we are not breaching ITS Terms and conditions. Also, please note it will be your responsibility to make sure no one is torrenting or abusing this wifi in accordance to the terms and conditions of rhodes network usage.
            
3. _**eduroam.**_ You can also log in with your eduroam credentials.
