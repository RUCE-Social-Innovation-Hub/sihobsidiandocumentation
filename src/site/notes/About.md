# About

The Digital Resource Library (DRL) is a public access library of basic technologies. This includes computing devices like laptops, mobile devices like tablets, audio-visual devices like cameras and recorders and a range of accessories.

To ensure the sustainability of the library, the management of devices and leases must be well structured. As a digital social innovation, the library uses accessible digital tools to manage its operations.

This document describes the management and operations of the digital resource centre.

# ASSET MANAGEMENT
## ASSET TAGS
In order to keep track of various assets available, there is need to develop a tagging system that would differentiate the different asssets that are of the same type. This makes it also easier to give information about a specific asset without confusion as to which asset is being referred to.


#### Barcodes
Barcodes for smaller non-RU assets are catalogued in the Google Drive on the [SIH asset tags (barcodes)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15AfW-mC6pktVMW2x2FFRot9Gs58E7M1z/edit#gid=173501204) Google Sheets. Copies are in the cupboard for loans and a copy is in the Office. It is updated as new accessories are added.

On the ‘unused’ tab of the [SIH asset tags (barcodes)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15AfW-mC6pktVMW2x2FFRot9Gs58E7M1z/edit#gid=173501204) Google sheets are all the new asset tags that have not been used. A Google Sheet function is used to automatically generate barcodes from a website called Berrywing.com. The equation is inserted on every row of the ‘Barcode’ column, where C3 is row 3 of ASSET Tag Column with all the asset tags that you want to generate the barcode from. The barcodes are generated using the equation:

=if(isblank(C3), "BLANK",image("http://berrywing.com/barcode/Code128.aspx?bc=" & C3))

![Barcodes.png](/img/user/Obsidian%20For%20Eric%20to%20organize%20his%20mind/ASSETS%20&%20DEVICES/Aseet%20Management/Barcodes.png)

## ASSET REGISTER
Asset registers are methods through which we keep track of our assets. There are divided into two groups, the manual and automated methods.

## [**Zapier.com**](https://zapier.com/)

Zapier is an online automation tool that connects different services online and automating them as needed.   The Free plan offers only two actions such as connecting gmail to google drive or gmail to google tasks.

For our purposes, Zapier is used to generate tasks on [socialinnovationhub.ru@gmail.com](mailto:socialinnovationhub.ru@gmail.com) that relate to assets needing to be renewed as their expiry date comes close. It is also used to transfer attached pdf(s) of various activities to google drive for future reference purposes. These activities are described below in detail.

  
  
![Zapier.png](/img/user/Obsidian%20For%20Eric%20to%20organize%20his%20mind/ASSETS%20&%20DEVICES/Aseet%20Management/Zapier.png)

  
  

1. _Asset Tiger -_ Asset Tiger sends an automated email to [socialinnovaitonhub.ru@gmail.com](mailto:socialinnovaitonhub.ru@gmail.com), [t.matyobeni@ru.ac.za](mailto:t.matyobeni@ru.ac.za) and [kamau757@gmail.com](mailto:kamau757@gmail.com) every week on Friday morning with an attached pdf of the current asset status. Basically, the lab manager. This can be customized in Asset Tiger settings. Zapier is used to transfer this attached pdf from [socialinnovationhub.ru@gmail.com](mailto:socialinnovationhub.ru@gmail.com) to the [Asset Tiger Automated reports](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MdppvlIfEs5UvxRdhBIbeDm4ZNQnIJRy?usp=share_link) folder. This is a security measure in case records have been altered.
    
2. _Asset Tiger -_ Asset Tiger also sends a reminder email when equipment is about to expire. Zapier is used to add these emails onto google tasks on [socialinnovationhub.ru@gmail.com](mailto:socialinnovationhub.ru@gmail.com) account. This is just for convenience of the lab manager but can be turned off by clicking on the green raio button under Equipment Return zap on Zapier.
    
3. _Google Forms_ – When someone is in need of equipment, the fill in the google form on the following link: [https://forms.gle/jpZywszPTMD2XfEE8](https://forms.gle/jpZywszPTMD2XfEE8). This form sends an email with the attached pdf summarising what equipment is needed to [socialinnovationhub.ru@gmail.com](mailto:socialinnovationhub.ru@gmail.com), and to the lab manager’s email address. Zapier saves this attached pdf emailed by Google Forms, particularly, the [Proposal for long term loans form](https://forms.gle/jpZywszPTMD2XfEE8), in the [Proposal for equipment use](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11QFnhquAyg9O00DfyeMCIaeYxd_jZR9d?usp=share_link) folder on the shared SIH Drive for our records.

## ASSET TRACKING
The following devices are being tracked.

- MacOS Tracking happens using the [Find My](https://www.apple.com/icloud/find-my/) app on MacOS. All MacOS have a DST MAC # admin account. This Admin account must not be shared. This admin account is logged into the apple ID using [sihdevices@gmail.com](mailto:sihdevices@gmail.com), password in Bitwarden. It is this apple ID You can also access the web portal to track MacOS using this link: [https://www.icloud.com/find](https://www.icloud.com/find). It is very accurate in tracking.
    
- Android devices can be tracked using the following link: [https://www.google.com/android/find](https://www.google.com/android/find). They all use [sihvisitors@gmail.com](mailto:sihvisitors@gmail.com) as their default account. You will need to be are logged in using [sihvisitors@gmail.com](mailto:sihvisitors@gmail.com) in order to track them. Password in Bitwarden. As this is a public gmail account, they will be moved to a separate gmail account, different from [sihdevices@gmail.com](mailto:sihdevices@gmail.com). It is used to track the 10” tablets but not very accurate.
    
    - Samsung Tablets can be tracked using the link: [https://findmymobile.samsung.com](https://findmymobile.samsung.com/). They are using [sihdevices@gmail.com](mailto:sihdevices@gmail.com) samsung account; login in Bitwarden.
        
- Windows Laptops can be tracked using the following link: [https://account.microsoft.com/devices](https://account.microsoft.com/devices). They are logged in using [sihdevices@gmail.com](mailto:sihdevices@gmail.com) Microsoft account on the RUCE Admin account. Login details can be found in the main Bitwarden account. This Admin account must not be shared. It is not very accurate in tracking.






## SECURITY FLAWS IN ASSET TRACKING


### macOS

#### Security of Tracking Mechanisms:
1. [**Find My Mac**](https://www.icloud.com/find): Apple provides a built-in tracking mechanism called "Find My Mac" which integrates with iCloud.  uses the apple ID 
   - **Activation Lock**: This feature ties the device to Social Innovation hub Apple ID, requiring the ID and password, found on Bitwarden, to disable Find My Mac or reactivate the device after it has been erased.
#### How Easy to Circumvent:
1. **Bypassing Activation Lock**:
   - **Firmware Reset**: A determined thief might attempt to perform a firmware reset using tools like Apple Configurator, but this often requires access to another Mac.
   - **Professional Tools**: There are illegal tools and services that claim to bypass Apple's Activation Lock, but these often require physical access to the hardware and are not easily accessible to average users.
2. **Removing the Hard Drive**:
   - **Replacement**: Removing and replacing the hard drive can circumvent the software-based tracking, but this also involves significant technical skills and tools, and the data on the original drive would be lost.



### WindowsOS

#### Security of Tracking Mechanisms:
1. [**Find My Device**](https://account.microsoft.com/devices?lang=en-GB#main-content-landing-react): Windows offers "Find My Device" which links to a Microsoft account who's password can also be found in Bitwarden.
   - **BitLocker Encryption**: If enabled, BitLocker provides disk encryption, adding a layer of security. However, to re-install the operating system, one needs to disable bitlocker encryption. 
   - **Secure Boot**: Ensures that the device boots using only trusted software from the OEM. May need to be disabled when installing windows operating system as described in [[Obsidian For Eric to organize his mind/ASSETS & DEVICES/Device Maintenance/Installing Windows 10 on a PC or laptop\|Installing Windows 10 on a PC or laptop]]
#### How Easy to Circumvent:
1. **Disabling Find My Device**:
   - **Local Account**: If the thief can access the local account settings, they might disable the Find My Device feature, although this typically requires administrator privileges.
   - **Factory Reset**: A factory reset can disable tracking, though BitLocker may prevent data access if enabled.
2. **Boot from External Media**:
   - **Live USB/CD**: Booting from an external USB drive or CD with a Linux distribution can bypass the Windows OS, although this does not necessarily disable tracking but can provide access to the device without triggering it.
   - **Reset BIOS/UEFI**: Resetting BIOS/UEFI settings to disable Secure Boot can help in accessing the device, but requires technical knowledge and can be easily blocked by enabling BitLocker Encryption.



### AndroidOS

#### Security of Tracking Mechanisms:
1. [**Find My Device**](https://www.google.com/android/find/): Android’s built-in tracking mechanism for the social innovation hub android devices links to the Google account sihvisitors@gmail.com .
   - **Factory Reset Protection (FRP)**: This feature prevents the device from being used after a factory reset without the original Google account credentials. However, it varies with device make and model. 
   - **Google Play Protect**: Continuously scans for malware and provides some level of security against unauthorized access.

#### How Easy to Circumvent:
1. **Disabling Find My Device**:
   - **Factory Reset**: Performing a factory reset is a common way to disable tracking, but FRP ensures that the device cannot be reactivated without the original credentials.
2. **Bypassing FRP**:
   - **Exploits and Tools**: There are known exploits and third-party tools that can bypass FRP, but these are often patched by Google and require technical knowledge.
   - **Custom ROMs**: Installing a custom ROM can circumvent factory settings and disable tracking features, but this requires unlocking the bootloader, which is not always possible without the original owner's consent.
3. **Physical Access**:
   - **Hardware Tampering**: Removing the battery (if possible) or altering hardware components can disable tracking, but modern devices with non-removable batteries make this difficult.




### Other Devices
Other devices such as cameras and tripod stands are not tracked.

# WINDOWS ISO & SOFTWARE


We keep all our ISO(s) and ISO installation software downloaded and stored locally on a flash drive as shown below, ==as well as on Google Drive on this link: ------==. This enables us to work both offline in situations where there is no internet access, as well as work faster in that we wont have to wait for an ISO file to download before setting up a bootable flashdrive. 

![WindowsISO.jpg](/img/user/Obsidian%20For%20Eric%20to%20organize%20his%20mind/ASSETS%20&%20DEVICES/Device%20Maintenance/WindowsISO.jpg)



#### WINDOWS ISO(S)

The flash drive shown above has the following list of windows ISO files in the main OS ISO folder:
1. en-us_windows_10_iot_enterprise_ltsc_2021_x64_dvd_257ad90f.iso which can also be downloaded from https://archive.org/details/en-us_windows_10_enterprise_ltsc_2021_x64_dvd_d289cf96_202212
2. Win_10_Pro_Build_18363.1909.476.iso which can also be downloaded from https://archive.org/details/win10pro1909.476lite


Details of the two ISO(s) are as follows:

1. en-us_windows_10_iot_enterprise_ltsc_2021_x64_dvd_257ad90f.iso is our version 1 windows installation ISO and the one we use on a regular at the Social Innovation Hub. It is a Long Term Servicing Channel, a version of Windows 10 that is designed for use cases where stability and compatibility are more important than access to new features. LTSC releases of Windows 10 are intended for devices that are used in critical systems, such as medical equipment or air traffic control systems or industrial controllers. The primary reason why we use this in the Social Innovation Hub is to reduce the number of windows feature updates, and get a more cleaner version of windows with minimum bloatware.
    
2. Win_10_Pro_Build_18363.1909.476.iso is our windows lean version 2 windows installation. Windows 10 Lean is a smaller edition of Windows 10 for devices with 16GB of storage or less. It is also known as Windows 10 CloudE or Windows 10 S. It has a smaller footprint and less features than the regular Windows 10, such as no Registry Editor, no Microsoft Management Console, no wallpapers, no drivers for CD/DVD drives, and so on. It is designed to run faster and more efficiently on low-end devices. We use this as our version 3 windows installation because it does not have bloatware at all and can run efficiently on low specs devices. However, we will have to hunt down for drivers for this version of windows.
    
The rest of the ISO files in the Archive folder are experimental and have not been fully implemented. 
	Please feel free to play around with them as per requirements. However, Windows 10 Lite Edition 19H2 x64.iso seemed to run slow for some strange reason after installation. It slowed down the computer using this version of windows and i needed more time to investigate. tiny10 21H2 x64 2209.iso is still untested.


#### WINDOWS INSTALLATION SOFTWARE(S)
The flash drive shown above also has the following list of installation software:
1. rufus-3.20.exe
2. YUMI-2.0.9.4.exe
3. YUMI-UEFI-0.0.4.5.exe
4. MediaCreationTool21H2.exe
5. balenaEtcher-Setup-1.7.9.exe
6. balenaEtcher-Portable-Legacy-1.7.9.exe

# Windows OS installation

A bootable flash drive is one which can be used to install an operating system to a computer, which in our case, Windows 10 operating system. 

In order to create a bootable flash drive, we need both the Windows ISO and Software (RUFUS) described in [[Obsidian For Eric to organize his mind/ASSETS & DEVICES/Device Maintenance/WINDOWS ISO & SOFTWARE\|WINDOWS ISO & SOFTWARE]]. 



## Creating Windows 10 USB using Rufus

To create a Windows 10 USB using Rufus (UEFI or Legacy), you can follow these steps:  
_Note_: Before proceeding, make sure you have a Windows 10 ISO file and a USB flash drive with at least 8 GB of storage capacity.


1. Go to the Rufus website ([https://rufus.ie/](https://rufus.ie/)) and download the latest version of Rufus.

2. Once downloaded, run the Rufus executable file to launch the application.

3. Select your USB drive 
	- In the “Device” drop down menu, select the USB flash drive you want to use for creating the Windows 10 USB. (1) in the image above

4. Choose the partition scheme (4) in the image above.
	- MBR is compatible with older BIOS systems and can be used to install windows on extremely old PCs and laptops
	- GPT requires UEFI. GPT is not bootable on BIOS-only systems without compatibility layers. Therefore, we use GPT with more recent PCs and laptops. 

5. Chose target system type (5) in the image above:
	- For Legacy/BIOS or Extremely old PCs and laptops: Under “Partition scheme,” select “[MBR](https://hollandsweb.com/tag/mbr-disk/)” and under “Target system,” select “BIOS or UEFI”.
	- For UEFI or newer PCs and laptops: Under “Partition scheme,” select “[GPT](https://hollandsweb.com/tag/gpt-disk/)” and under “Target system,” select “UEFI (non-CSM).”


6. _Note_: The selection of UEFI or Legacy depends on the type of system you plan to install Windows 10 on. If your computer supports UEFI, it’s recommended to choose the UEFI option.


7. Select the Windows 10 ISO: 
	- Click on the small disk icon next to the “Boot selection” section and browse to the location where you have the Windows 10 ISO file, which for us, can be found as detailed in [[Obsidian For Eric to organize his mind/ASSETS & DEVICES/Device Maintenance/WINDOWS ISO & SOFTWARE\|WINDOWS ISO & SOFTWARE]]. Select the ISO file and click “Open.”


8. Configure Rufus settings:
	- File system: Select “[**NTFS**](https://hollandsweb.com/tag/ntfs/)” (**recommended**) or “FAT32” as the file system for the USB drive.
	- Volume label: You can provide a custom name for the USB drive if you want.
	- Check the “Quick format” and “Create extended label and icon files” options.
	- Leave all other settings as default unless you have specific requirements.


9. Start the Windows 10 USB creation process (8) in the image above:


10. **Rufus** will display a warning message that all data on the USB will be destroyed. Ensure you have backed up any important data from the USB drive, as this process will format it.


11. Click “**OK**” to proceed, and Rufus will start creating the **Windows 10 USB**. It may take several minutes to complete the process, depending on your system’s speed and the size of the ISO file.


12. Once Rufus completes the process, it will display a “**READY**” status. You can now close Rufus and safely remove the **USB flash drive**.


## Windows 10 installation flash drives

We followed the procedure detailed in [[Obsidian For Eric to organize his mind/ASSETS & DEVICES/Device Maintenance/Windows OS installation#Creating Windows 10 USB using Rufus\|Windows OS installation#Creating Windows 10 USB using Rufus]] to make the four bootable flash drives shown in the image below

![WindowsInstallation.jpg](/img/user/Obsidian%20For%20Eric%20to%20organize%20his%20mind/ASSETS%20&%20DEVICES/Device%20Maintenance/WindowsInstallation.jpg)

These installation drives have the following differences:

1. _**Pink:**_ This flashdrive has Windows 10 Lean installed (Win_10_Pro_Build_18363.1909.476.iso from [[Obsidian For Eric to organize his mind/ASSETS & DEVICES/Device Maintenance/WINDOWS ISO & SOFTWARE\|WINDOWS ISO & SOFTWARE]]). 
	- Windows 10 lean is suitable for low spec or very old computers as it does not need a lot of resources to run. The price to pay is having to find drivers. 
	- ***We archived this version of windows***, as it became difficult for end-users to use, since it lacked a lot of the needed windows features such as the ability to connect and share files through Bluetooth. It needs time investment to iron out everything missing, and install accordingly.  



2. _**Blue & Purple:**_ These flashdrives have Windows 10 LTSC UEFI version (en-us_windows_10_iot_enterprise_ltsc_2021_x64_dvd_257ad90f.iso from [[Obsidian For Eric to organize his mind/ASSETS & DEVICES/Device Maintenance/WINDOWS ISO & SOFTWARE\|WINDOWS ISO & SOFTWARE]]). 
	- This uses more resources than Windows 10 Lean, but less than the default windows 10 that comes with the PC or Laptop. It is suitable for medium-capacity computers. Practically, it can be used interchangeably with Windows 10 Lean, but Windows 10 Lean feels more snappier when using compared to LTSC windows 10.



3. _**Red:**_ This flashdrive has Windows 10 LTSC Legacy installation specifically meant to be used with older PCs (Please see [[Obsidian For Eric to organize his mind/ASSETS & DEVICES/Device Maintenance/Windows OS installation#Creating Windows 10 USB using Rufus\|Windows OS installation#Creating Windows 10 USB using Rufus]] above for details). 
	- It is used to install windows in old desktop computers that do not support UEFI mode.

# GOOGLE ACCOUNTS

Rhodes University uses Google Workspace to host their communications. This includes
- Premium access to Drive storage, 
- Gmail and documents.

[_**sihdevices@gmail.com**_](mailto:sihdevices@gmail.com)

This is the Google Account for device management and tracking. This account must be kept secure. It is also the owner of the Bitwarden account. Only the Digital Resource Library manager needs to have the password for this account. No content is saved on Google Drive yet.

[_**ruce.community.engagement@gmail.com**_]((mailto:ruce.community.engagement@gmail.com)

This account was made to manage MacOS devices via Bitwarden.

[_**socialinnovationhub.ru@gmail.com**_]((mailto:socialinnovationhub.ru@gmail.com)

This is the communications account for the Social Innovation Hub and the address that is shared with visitors. Users can use this account to find information, RSVP, book workspaces and loan equipment. Nothing is saved on the Main Drive. However, this account has two shared drives: Sih Visitors and Social Innovation Hub drives.

[_**sihvisitors@gmail.com**_]((mailto:sihvisitors@gmail.com)

This is a less secure admin account for the Social Innovation Hub and can be used to store data temporarily, share it with users, etc. It is meant to be accessed by the public. It is also used to store bookmarks and other important information on Google Chrome across our devices at the SIH Hub. It is also connected to SIH Visitors shared drive

# BITWARDEN

[Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/resources/move-to-bitwarden-from-other-password-manager/) is a password manager where all the accounts and associated passwords used by the Social Innovation Hub are stored securely. The password to log in to Bitwarden must never be saved on any device and is recorded by the lab manager for security.

There is a [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bitwarden-free-password-m/nngceckbapebfimnlniiiahkandclblb?hl=en) which can be used to access passwords easily, but must be logged out at each reset.

There are a number of Bitwarden account each serving its purpose as described below:

1. [sihdevices@gmail.com](mailto:sihdevices@gmail.com): This is our main Bitwarden account and has all our login details for everything we do at the hub. It also stores the password details for the subsequent Bitwarden accounts. However, this bitwarden account shares MacOS Login information with [ruce.community.engagement@gmail.com](mailto:ruce.community.engagement@gmail.com) Bitwarden account.
    
2. [ruce.community.engagement@gmail.com](mailto:ruce.community.engagement@gmail.com) Bitwarden account was made to keep all MacOS related login details separate from [sihdevices@gmail.com](mailto:sihdevices@gmail.com). Therefore, [sihdevices@gmail.com](mailto:sihdevices@gmail.com) now shares all MacOS details that belonged to it with [ruce.community.engagement@gmail.com](mailto:ruce.community.engagement@gmail.com) with the aim to eventually disconnect [sihdevices@gmail.com](mailto:sihdevices@gmail.com) by transferring ownership to [ruce.community.engagement@gmail.com](mailto:ruce.community.engagement@gmail.com).
    
3. [socialinnovationhub.ru@gmail.com](mailto:socialinnovationhub.ru@gmail.com) Bitwarden account was made to keep people’s password details. This is because sometimes the lab manager will help setup accounts for people, and some people forget the setup account details. In this case, the lab manager would need to remember them.
    

Every new Equipment Manager should change the Bitwarden and Gmail passwords under [sihdevices@gmail.com](mailto:sihdevices@gmail.com) and [ruce.community.engagement@gmail.com](mailto:ruce.community.engagement@gmail.com) as they are the core of everything, and you want to protect the core. Make the password secure and complicated - a combination of letters, numbers, cases and phrases. The password should be unique and not used anywhere else.

# SIH Fixed Lab


There are a number of ways to connect to the internet from SIH Fixed lab at Rhodes University as documented below.

1. _**rucelab**_ is a hidden network with a highly secure password saved by ITS and the lab managers. You can also find its password on Bitwarden. Only registered devices, whose mac addresses have been added to the database of allowed devices by ITS can connect to rucelab.
    
2. _**RUCE; Social Innovation Hub**_ is our own wifi, password Wsih2022 also on Bitwarden. There are a number of ways to make this wifi.
    
    1. Using a Dell Laptop, connect to eduroam or rucelab, then enable hotspot using the ssid mentioned above. This is however a temporary solution as the laptop may be leased, and also allows only a limited number of laptops to connect simultaneously. Details on how to use the desktop computer as a hotspot can be found here:

</div></div>

        
    2. Using a Desktop computer connected to the internet via ethernet cable and a usb wifi dongle, you can start a wifi hotspot the same way as (1) above. This works as long as the desktop is turned on. Also, from experience, the wifi signal from this strategy is not that strong and does not travel far, therefore, inadequate for large classes occupying the social innovation hub. Details on how to use the desktop computer as a hotspot can be found here: [[Obsidian For Eric to organize his mind/Internet Connection/Configuring and using PC and laptop hotspot\|Configuring and using PC and laptop hotspot]]
        
    3. Using the Huawei LTE router, connect an ethernet cable from the WAN port of the router to the ethernet outlet on the wall, then plug into the power supply. Our Hub’s router’s ssid and password have already been configured to match the details above, and the router configured to act as a bridge. After you connect to this router’s wifi, you will be brought a login screen, where you will register the router the way you’d register a device connected to the ethernet like a desktop. Once registered, the router’s mac address is attached to your rhodes credentials and anyone who connects to this wifi can now browse the internet.

## STORAGE
  


### Google Drive
Rhodes University uses Google Workspace therefore enabling premium access to Drive storage. ==This comes with the ability to create a shared drive storage each 500 GB capacity. ==

Consequently, we have the following shared drives:
- Sih Visitors
- Social Innovation Hub 
- RUCE  

#### Google Drive for Desktop

To easily manage and share content across all your devices and the cloud, use Google’s desktop sync client: Drive for desktop. Drive for desktop can be used to find your Drive files and folders on your computer with Windows File Explorer or macOS Finder.

If you edit, delete, or move a file on the Cloud, the same change happens on your computer and devices, and vice versa. That way, your files are always up to date and can be accessed from any device.


#### Install & set up Drive for desktop

1. Download Drive for desktop:
    [DOWNLOAD FOR WINDOWS](https://dl.google.com/drive-file-stream/GoogleDriveSetup.exe)

2. Open "GoogleDriveSetup.exe."

3. Follow the on-screen instructions.


On Drive for desktop, at the bottom right, in the system tray, you can find the Drive for desktop menu ![Drive File Stream](https://storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/jiEgyvvMKdtzVV3MoCUyl0EWTmekFj0smSXr).

**Tip:** To ”Show hidden icons,” click the arrow.
